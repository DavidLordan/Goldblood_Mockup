# Goldblood_Mockup
This is a mock-up page showcasing the design of the Gold Blood & Associates' (my band) new website. 

<p>Not much functionallity yet, it's still brand new. The main purpose of this however was to 
solve the problem of bands updating their site's info. All anyone in the band has to
do is jump over to the blog-admin site and make a post. No knowledge of coding required.</p>

<p>Take a look inside the blog_admin folder to see the real meat of the project.</p>

<h4>Demos:</h4>
<p>Band Page: http://www.daves-data.com/GB_MockUp/ </p>
<p>Blog Admin: http://www.daves-data.com/test_blog/ </p>

<p>Anything posted on the blog control site will automatically be published on the band's public site. Users can conveniently
add, edit, or delete posts. So easy a musician can do it!</p>
