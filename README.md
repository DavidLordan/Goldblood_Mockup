# Goldblood_Mockup
This is a mock-up page showcasing the new design of the Gold Blood & Associates' (my band) new website. 

<p>The main purpose of this was trying to solve the problem of ban's updating their site's info. All anyone in the band has to
do is jump over to the blog-admin site and make a post. No knowledge of coding required.</p>

<p>Take a look inside the blog_admin folder to see all of the files.</p>

<h4>Demos:</h4>
<p>Band Page: http://www.daves-data.com/GB_MockUp/ </p>
<p>Blog Admin: http://www.daves-data.com/test_blog/ </p>

<p>Anything posted on the blog control site will automatically be published on the band's public site. Users can easily
add, edit, or delete posts. So easy a musician can do it!</p>
